# Pokemon Memory Game

A basic implementation of the Memory Game outlined in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card).

## How to Play

Try not to click the same card twice! Clicking the same card twice will draw you a new set of cards and reset your score back to 0. Try and score as high as possible (10 with 10 cards) without clicking the same card twice. Cards that are in the view are shuffled when clicked.

## Live Demo

A live demo can be played here on [Netlify](https://peppy-conkies-967555.netlify.app/).

## Todo

-   Refine UI and display
-   Possibly add card flipping/deck animations + sounds?
